# Data Science Project on Steam

In this project we will use a Dataset with 27,075 games on **Steam**, the popular PC gaming platform. This list is current from inception to April 2019.


## Motivation.
Learn and practice within the branch of data science.


## Problem it solves.
With the following DataFrame we will answer the following **10 questions**:
1. What is the TOP10 most played games?
2. What is the best-selling video game genre?
3. What genres have better average reviews?
4. How much has the developer who has sold the most games earned?
5. How does it affect reviews that a game is Early Access?
6. Which is the developer (or developers) that has developed more types of games and quantity?
7. In which month, since we have data, have the most games been published?
8. How many hours do you play each type of game on average monthly?
9. Free to Play games have better or worse reviews?
10. How has the number of achievements (trophies) per game evolved?


## You learned.
To fix my dataset data, use lambdas, ReGex, deal with NaN, change my variables to be able to manage them more easily, etc.


## Features.
* The project was carried out in a jupyter labs notebook.
* Within the project doubts are resolved and observations are written as the project progresses.
* You can interact with many of the graphs since the Plotly library was used.
* There should be no style flaws in the code, as it has been revised multiple times.


## Participants.
The project was carried out individually, thanks to me for not giving up.
